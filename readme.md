#Proton (2.0.0-rc1 [SemVer](http://semver.org/))

Proton is a protocol for Student Robotics match scoring scripts.

##Execution

1. A proton compliant program MUST be either a script including a `#!` line
   or be a binary.

2. A proton compliant program MUST be capable of being exec'd on a supported
   platform. This typically means that it has the executable bit set.

3. A proton compliant program MUST run on Linux.

4. A proton compliant program MUST NOT have any side effects beyond printing
   to STDERR, STDOUT and having a return code. This precludes:
   modifying its input, writing to a database or any other kind of I/O.

5. A proton compliant program MUST always give the same output for a given
   input.

##Inputs

Note: A TLA is defined as a string matching the regex `[a-zA-Z]{3}[a-zA-Z0-9]*`.

1. A proton compliant program MUST consume one or more arguments which are the
   paths to YAML files containing computerised interpretations of Student
   Robotics scoresheets.

    1.0 A proton compliant program MUST be able to files from both
        absolute and relative paths.

    1.1 A proton compliant program MUST accept YAML files with the proton
        format, these are of the form:

```

    match_number: integer
    arena_id: integer or string representing arena identity
    teams: dictionary with 2-4 key value pairs:
        TLA: dictionary with key value pairs:
            zone: an integer between 0 and 3 inclusive
            disqualified: an optional boolean, defaulting to false
            present: an optional boolean, defaulting to true

            any other key value pairs representing data about scoring specific
            to the year and game.

```

    1.2 A proton compliant program MUST exit with 1 if the input is malformed
        YAML or does not comply with rule 1.1

2. A proton compliant program MUST consume YAML from stdin if it is not
   given any filenames.

3. A proton compliant program MAY refuse to process an input if it detects
   nested scoring values it is unable to process. If this occurs it MUST
   exit with 2.

##Outputs

1. A proton compliant program MUST print a YAML list to STDOUT if it
   succeeds.

2. Each element of the list must be a YAML dictionary.

    2.1 The dictionaries must be of the form:

  ```
  version: string representing version of the proton protocol implemented i.e. (1.0.0)
  match_number: an integer representing the match number
  arena_id: integer or string representing arena identity
  scores: dictionary with exactly as many keys there were teams in the input
      TLA: dictionary with exactly the key value pairs
          score: numeric value, representing team's score (game points).
          present: boolean, value from the input
          disqualified: boolean, value from the input
          zone: integer, the zone the team was in
  ```

3. A proton compliant program must contain the exact number of outputs in the
   output list as it was given inputs, or one output in the list if the input
   was accepted from STDIN.

4. A proton compliant program MUST exit with 0 if it succeeds.

5. A proton compliant program's output to STDOUT MUST be considered unusable if
   it fails.

6. A proton compliant program MAY print to STDERR under any circumstances.
